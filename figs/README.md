# ADS Project 1: What made you happy today?
### Figs folder

The figs directory contains the figures. This directory only contains generated files; that is, one should always be able to delete the contents and regenerate them.

"what-makes-you-happy.jpg", "ice-cream-boston.jpg", and "video-game-friend-group-1024x682.jpg" are images used in the presentation.
