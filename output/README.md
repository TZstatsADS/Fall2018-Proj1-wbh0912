# ADS Project 1: What made you happy today?
### Output folder

The output directory contains analysis output, processed datasets, logs, or other processed things.

`processed_moments.csv` is the dataset generated by the starter code, not the final version used in "Project 1.Rmd". The final version is defined in Step 0-2 in the code file.
