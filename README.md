### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Project title: Are you happy momentarily or continuously?
+ This project is conducted by Binhan Wang

+ Project summary: `HappyDB` is a dataset of happy moments based on Amazon's Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing service. After some data-processing, I conducted a little research on the nature behind momentary and sustained happiness. First, I took a quick look at the data through some exploratory data analysis, and failed to find a special pattern. Then, I tried to analyze people's habit of describing these two types of happiness using the length of their statements, and I found that sustained joy is likely to be described with one or two more words. Finally, I applied natural language processing techniques to find out the most frequent words and phrases in two groups so that we have an idea of their focus. The result suggests that momentary happiness mostly comes from daily casual activities while sustained happiness comes from meaningful life events.
